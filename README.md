# JetTipApp
JetTipApp is a Jetpack Compose-based Android application that helps users calculate tips and split bills efficiently. This project is built using **Jetpack Compose**, Google's modern UI toolkit for declarative and reactive UI development in Android.

## ðŸ“Œ About Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development by using a declarative approach, meaning you describe **what** the UI should look like, and Compose takes care of updating it dynamically. It eliminates the need for XML layouts and integrates seamlessly with Kotlin, making UI development faster and more intuitive.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of JetTipApp
This app is designed to:
- âœ… Calculate the tip based on the bill amount and tip percentage.
- âœ… Split the bill evenly among a group of people.
- âœ… Provide a simple and clean user experience using Jetpack Compose.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Jetpack Compose** â€“ For modern UI development
- **Material 3 Components** â€“ For theming and UI consistency
- **Kotlin** â€“ Primary programming language
- **State Management** â€“ Using `remember` and `mutableStateOf` for UI updates

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, you will learn:
- How to use **Jetpack Compose** for UI development
